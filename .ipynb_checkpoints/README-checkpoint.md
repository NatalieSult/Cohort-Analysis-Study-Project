# Cohort-Analysis-Study-Project
Cohort analysis study project: tested low retention hypotheses, analyzed business metrics, prioritized ideas using ICE.

## Objective
- Analyze user retention over time using cohort analysis.
- Identify and test hypotheses for low retention.
- Analyze key business metrics to support insights.
- Prioritize hypotheses using the ICE (Impact, Confidence, Ease) framework.

## Data
- The dataset is anonymized and safe for sharing
- Split into three CSV files, all located in the `data/` folder

## Methods
- Cohort creation based on first purchase/registration month
- Calculation of retention rates per cohort
- Heatmap visualization of retention over time
- Hypothesis testing for low retention
- Definition and analysis of key business metrics to evaluate overall performance
- Prioritization of hypotheses using ICE scoring (Impact, Confidence, Ease)

## Visualizations
- Retention heatmap
- User retention curves by cohort
- Business metrics charts (revenue, orders per user)

## Conclusions
- Identified cohorts with the lowest retention
- Tested hypotheses explaining low retention
- Prioritized key hypotheses using ICE scoring

## Tools
- Python: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scipy.stats
- Jupyter Notebook
